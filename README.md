# CMSC389I: Disrupting Healthcare with AI
## Prerequisites: C- or better in CMSC250 and CMSC216
## Credits: 1

## Time and Location
Fridays, 2:00-2:50 PM  
CSIC 2118

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive, practical introduction to the intersection of machine learning and different challenges in healthcare. Students will apply basic predictive modeling techniques to fields such as early detection of disease, telemedicine, and mental health. Prior knowledge of biology is not required but a basic understanding of Python and/or machine learning techniques is recommended.

## Textbooks
Required:
- None

Recommended: 
- [Secondary Analysis of EHRs](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319437408) by MIT Critical Data

## Topics Covered
- Machine Learning for Healthcare
- Early Disease Detection
- Electronic Health Records
- Telemedicine
- Mental Health

## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department <a href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu/">grades server</a>.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 20% | Quizzes | We will regularly have quizzes in class based on readings from the previous week or in-class slides/lecture. |
| 40% | Codelabs | Codelabs will be centered around analyzing specific datasets for a domain we cover in class. |
| 40% | Final Project | The final project will be an original machine-learning model for a unique dataset in the healthcare domain. Students may draw inspiration from existing research papers, but must analyze the dataset themselves. All students will present their results at the end of the semester. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests
will be considered afterwards.

## Projects
The projects are meant to get you familiar with the techniques used to analyze healthcare datasets. Projects will focus on applying machine-learning models to domains such as early disease detection, electronic health records, and drug discovery. The projects will be implemented in Python for simplicity.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: in-person during office hours and piazza. Email should
only be used for emergencies and not class related questions (e.g., homework).

## Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations
See the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or Missed Assignments" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a>.

## Disability Support Accommodations

See the section titled "Accessibility" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a>.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
